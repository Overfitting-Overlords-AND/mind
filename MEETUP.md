We will work in pairs. Find another learner at roughly your same skill level and tackle one of the listed Kaggle competitions.

Feel free to seek help and ask questions during the meetup. We will stop at 20:30 and present your work. At 21:00 then we will wrap up :)

If you are a complete beginner aim to submit a working solution, donâ€™t worry about your model accuracy.
